Installation
============

GNU autotools are used for building and installing xchainkeys:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

This README file and an example configuration file will be installed
to $PREFIX/share/doc/xchainkeys/. A manual page is included.

The standard DESTDIR variable can be used for a staged install.

similar to those found in the ratpoison window manager or the screen
terminal multiplexer.

your ~/.xinitrc:

   xchainkeys &

Alternatively use your WM/DE's autostart mechanism to start xchainkeys
as a background process.

example config file $PREFIX/share/doc/xchainkeys/example.conf to the
