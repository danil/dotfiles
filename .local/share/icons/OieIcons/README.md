An incremental project made for fun  ;) . Each week we will release a batch of colorful icons for your Linux environment :penguin: .

### Installation

Download, extract and place the icon folder in

```bash
~/.local/share/icons/
```
This icon set is in continuous development, we recommend combining it with the [OieOxy](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1300159/)  folder set. ;)
