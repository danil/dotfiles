# Programms are run using execv(), not a shell, so you can't do things
# like redirecting the output to a file. The command string is split
# using blank characters as separators, the first element is the
# command to be executed and the rest are parameters, so if you use
# "echo Playing: %i" we run program echo (from $PATH) with 2
# parameters: 'Playing:' string and the title. Even if the title
# contains spaces it's still one parameter and it's safe if it
# contains `rm -rf /`.
#
# Examples:
# ExecCommand1		= "cp %f /mnt/usb_drive"
# ExecCommand2		= "/home/joe/now_playing %i"
ExecCommand1		= "rm %f"
ExecCommand2		= "rmdir %f"
